MATCHING/RECOMMENDATION PROBLEM


Problem Statement: 
The program shall create matching between two sets, and show the best matches between those two sets.


Possible Solution:
Creating a solution in Java.


Data Assumption: 
To create a match between the sets, each element must require certain attributes to describe its nature, having common attributes creates a matching between each set's elements with another set’s elements.
For example- 
Dataset 1: Job titles and Skills required for the job
Dataset 2: Candidates and their skillset


Approach: 
        Pseudocode- 
1. Load Data Set 1
2. Load Data Set 2
3. Match Data sets
4. Sort Both sets
5. Identify the best matches


        Graphical Representation of Data-
                        The result data(best matches for each element of the one dataset against the other dataset) i.e. the resultant data set:-

Known Issues:
- The generated data file must be manually posted in the graphics data.
- Needs further graphical beautification.
